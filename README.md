# Image.Recognition.ML
This project showcases an end-to-end image classification system built using deep learning. The main objective was to develop a model capable of recognizing and classifying images accurately using both a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a fine-tuned pre-trained model (MobileNetV2). The project covers all stages,  from preprocessing and training to evaluation and visualization
Dataset: Used a publicly available image dataset (e.g. MNIST, CIFAR-10 or Cats vs Dogs)

Preprocessing: Images were resized, normalized, and augmented using techniques like rotation and flipping

Model 1 – Custom CNN: Implemented from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras; trained and validated on the dataset

Model 2 – Transfer Learning: Fine-tuned MobileNetV2 to improve accuracy and reduce training time

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix, and ROC Curve

Visualization: Training/validation curves, confusion matrices, and prediction outputs were generated using Matplotlib
