# Image.Recognition.ML
This project showcases an end-to-end image classification system built using deep learning. The main objective was to develop a model capable of recognizing and classifying images accurately using both a (CNN) and a pre-trained model (MobileNetV2). The project covers all stages,  from preprocessing and training to evaluation and visualization.
